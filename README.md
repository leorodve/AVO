Program still under development.

Calculates and display Intercept, Gradient, Pseudo Poisson and Fluid Factor attributes given CMP gathers and a Velocity field file (ASCII). More attributes to be added in the future.

This program was tested using a seismic section containing multiple reflectors, one of which experience a decrease of its amplitude with the offset.

The maximum angle of incidence is close to 20°, making it acceptable to use Shuey's two term AVO equation.

After uploading both files (CMP gathers and velocity field) the program calculates and displays the Intercept (Rp), Gradient (G), Pseudo Poisson (Δσ) and Fluid Factor(ΔF) using linear regression and Shuey's two term AVO equation.

If we zoom in on the reflectors between 2050-2075 ms we get:

While the intercept section shows the sandstone (blue) with shale interbeddings (pale red) within the reservoir unit, the gradient section indicates variations in fluid saturation (indicated by the different tones of green) within the reservoir rocks. The green color in the fluid-factor section represents the gas-saturated reservoir sandstone.
