Program still under development.

Calculates and display Intercept and Gradient attributes given CMP gathers and Velocity field file (ASCII). More attributes to be added in the future.

This program was tested using synthetic data of a seismic section containing two reflectors, the first one experience a decrease of its amplitude with the offset.

The maximum angle of incidence is close to 20, making it acceptable to use Shuey's two term AVO equation.

After uploading both files (CMP gathers and velocity field) the program calculates and displays the Intercept (Rp) and Gradient (G) using linear regression and the Shuey's two term AVO equation.
