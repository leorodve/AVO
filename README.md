Program still under development.

Calculates and display Intercept and Gradient attributes given CMP gathers and a Velocity field file (ASCII). More attributes to be added in the future.

This program was tested using a seismic section containing multiple reflectors, one of which experience a decrease of its amplitude with the offset.

The maximum angle of incidence is close to 20°, making it acceptable to use Shuey's two term AVO equation.

After uploading both files (CMP gathers and velocity field) the program calculates and displays the Intercept (Rp), Gradient (G), Pseudo Poisson (Δσ) and Fluid Factor(ΔF) using linear regression and Shuey's two term AVO equation.

If we zoom in on the reflector between 2000-2200 ms we get:
